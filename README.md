What is churn prediction?
Churn prediction is predicting which customers are at high risk of leaving your company or canceling a subscription to a service, based on their behavior with your product. 

Why is predicting churn important?
According to a study done by McKinsey, technology and saas companies with the highest performance and revenue growth were also companies with high retention rates and low net revenue churn. 

The ability to predict churn before it happens allows businesses to take proactive actions to keep existing customers from churning. This could look like: 

Customer success teams reaching out to those high-risk customers to provide support or to gauge what needs may not be being met

Providing more targeted re-engagement campaigns, like reminder emails
Creating more focused customer education content 

Re-evaluating larger, company-wide retention initiatives like pricing

When predicting churn, you're not just identifying at-risk customers, youâ€™re also identifying pain points leading up to churn and helping to increase overall customer retention and satisfaction. Predicting churn helps in preventing churn. Preventing churn, in turn, serves as a great revenue source for businesses.
